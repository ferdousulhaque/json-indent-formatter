# JSON Indent Formatter
As the name describes, this is a simple JSON Indent Formatter for large files, which are not able to beautify from the IDE.

Idea was when I got a 100mb JSON file and tried to open it in an IDE. I was not able to format the JSON to see it as a clear view, as the json was only 1 liner.
