# JSON Indent Formatter
As the name describes, this is a simple JSON Indent Formatter for large files, which are not able to beautify from the IDE.

Idea was when I got a 100mb JSON file and tried to open it in an IDE. I was not able to format the JSON to see it as a clear view, as the json was only 1 liner.

## Run Script
If you have only one python version installed. Then use the following command to run.
```
python main.py
```
Next it will ask you the filepath. Share the full path to the file.
```
Provide file location:/home/ferdous/filename.json
```
It will then ask for the formatted json file name. By default, it is set as the current filename added _formatted at the end.
